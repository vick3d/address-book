# Address Book [es2015/ES6]

 This is a webb app that maintains our clients contacts. Its written in vanilla javascript, html and tailwind css.

 # Prerequisites
 In order for this to work you need to install:
 ``` 
   "devDependencies": {
    "cucumber": "^4.2.1",
    "mocha": "^5.0.5",
    "puppeteer": "^1.2.0",
    "superstatic": "^5.0.1"
     }
 ```
# Installation
This will install all the dependencies

```
yarn init
```
and this will start a server on your localhost port:3000
```
yarn run serve
```
and this will run the unit tests since we are working in a TDD way
```
yarn run cucumber
```
